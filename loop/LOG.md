# PROJECT LOG — append-only journal

> The permanent record. Skills append entries automatically at every
> meaningful event: work item opened/closed, task completed, decision made,
> session ended. NEVER edit or delete past entries — append only.
> HANDOFF.md says "where are we now"; this file says "how did we get here".

Entry format (newest at the BOTTOM, so git diffs are clean):

## 2026-07-03 — session — boilerplate initialized
- What: loop-boilerplate created; awaiting bootstrap
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: ADR-0001 (record decisions)
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — session — product brainstorm + architecture (pre-Loop, vibe skills)
- What: Bulk Saving (group-buy home services for societies) brainstormed → BRIEF.md; architecture designed → ARCHITECTURE.md; spec-review passed (0 P0/P1). Kept as reference docs at root.
- Evidence: spec-review 0 P0 / 0 P1 (vibe/spec-reviews/2026-09-16-brainstorm.md)
- Decisions: none yet formalized as ADRs at this point
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — bootstrap — stack contract filled (docs only, no deps)
- What: STACK.md + CLAUDE.md stack sections filled (React PWA + NestJS + Postgres + Redis + Prisma, pnpm monorepo). ARCHITECTURE.md decisions folded into ADR-0002..0005.
- Evidence: n/a (documentation only — no code, no dependencies installed)
- Decisions: ADR-0002 (monorepo/stack), ADR-0003 (shared-schema multi-tenancy), ADR-0004 (Postgres-authoritative round concurrency), ADR-0005 (Prisma over TypeORM)
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — triage — work map registered
- What: Registered CHORE-001 + FEAT-001..008 in REGISTRY.md with dependency-ordered build plan. Opened CHORE-001 (monorepo scaffold) with spec/plan/tasks.
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: none
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — opened, awaiting approval to execute
- What: CHORE-001 scaffold spec/plan/tasks written. BLOCKED: execution installs dependencies → needs human approval (CLAUDE.md "Ask the human before adding any dependency"). verify.sh still unconfigured until scaffold runs.
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — approved + executed (scaffold built)
- What: Human approved dependency install + Docker Compose (ADR-0006) + pnpm. Monorepo scaffolded (apps/backend NestJS+Prisma+BullMQ, apps/web React PWA + TanStack Query + Zustand, packages/shared). Dev DB/Redis via Docker Compose; host ports remapped to 5442/6399 (5432/6379 occupied). verify.sh wired: build shared → prisma generate → lint → typecheck → test.
- Evidence: prisma migrate dev --name init clean (HealthPing created); verify.sh exit 0.
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005, ADR-0006
- By: human-approved (build via subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — V2 independent review
- What: Independent reviewer ran verify.sh itself + audited scaffold vs spec + ARCHITECTURE. Verdict APPROVE after 3 minor fixes: F1 PWA icons (192/512 + maskable) so app is installable, F2 counter test now actually clicks, F3 web typecheck added to verify.sh. No P0.
- Evidence: reviewer verify.sh exit 0 (backend 5/5, web 3/3); grep found zero `any`/`@ts-ignore`/`eslint-disable`; BullMQ test confirmed real (not mocked).
- Decisions: none
- By: agent (independent reviewer subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — CLOSED (V3 + commit)
- What: Closer ran verify.sh 3× back-to-back — all exit 0, identical (backend 5 tests/3 suites, web 3 tests) → not flaky. git repo initialized; scaffold committed. REGISTRY → done.
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 ×3 (RUN1_EXIT=0, RUN2 identical, third run exit 0). Commit efd1526.
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005, ADR-0006
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — opened, spec drafted (awaiting approval)
- What: Created loop/work/FEAT-001-society-onboarding-otp-auth/ with spec.md (Society+Resident model, invite-code + phone-OTP onboarding, JWT access+refresh, roles, tenant isolation). 6 open questions pending human answers. No code until spec/plan approved (Loop rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (spec only)
- Decisions: ADR-0003 (applies); JWT-auth + OTP-storage ADRs to be written at plan time
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — open questions resolved; plan + tasks drafted
- What: Human resolved all 6 open questions (full-stack scope, stub SMS adapter, seed-script super-admin, default OTP policy). Wrote ADR-0007 (phone-OTP + JWT rotating refresh, OTP in Redis), plan.md, and tasks.md (15 tasks: backend T1–T9, frontend T10–T13, V2/V3 close). Status → planned. Awaiting plan approval before code (Loop rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (plan only)
- Decisions: ADR-0007
- By: agent (pending human plan approval)
