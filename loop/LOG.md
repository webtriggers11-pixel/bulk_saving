## 2026-07-03 — session — boilerplate initialized
- What: loop-boilerplate created; awaiting bootstrap
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: ADR-0001 (record decisions)
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — session — product brainstorm + architecture (pre-Loop, vibe skills)
- What: Bulk Saving (group-buy home services for societies) brainstormed → BRIEF.md; architecture designed → ARCHITECTURE.md; spec-review passed (0 P0/P1). Kept as reference docs at root.
- Evidence: spec-review 0 P0 / 0 P1 (vibe/spec-reviews/2026-09-16-brainstorm.md)
- Decisions: none yet formalized as ADRs at this point
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — bootstrap — stack contract filled (docs only, no deps)
- What: STACK.md + CLAUDE.md stack sections filled (React PWA + NestJS + Postgres + Redis + Prisma, pnpm monorepo). ARCHITECTURE.md decisions folded into ADR-0002..0005.
- Evidence: n/a (documentation only — no code, no dependencies installed)
- Decisions: ADR-0002 (monorepo/stack), ADR-0003 (shared-schema multi-tenancy), ADR-0004 (Postgres-authoritative round concurrency), ADR-0005 (Prisma over TypeORM)
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — triage — work map registered
- What: Registered CHORE-001 + FEAT-001..008 in REGISTRY.md with dependency-ordered build plan. Opened CHORE-001 (monorepo scaffold) with spec/plan/tasks.
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: none
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — opened, awaiting approval to execute
- What: CHORE-001 scaffold spec/plan/tasks written. BLOCKED: execution installs dependencies → needs human approval (CLAUDE.md "Ask the human before adding any dependency"). verify.sh still unconfigured until scaffold runs.
- Evidence: n/a
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — approved + executed (scaffold built)
- What: Human approved dependency install + Docker Compose (ADR-0006) + pnpm. Monorepo scaffolded (apps/backend NestJS+Prisma+BullMQ, apps/web React PWA + TanStack Query + Zustand, packages/shared). Dev DB/Redis via Docker Compose; host ports remapped to 5442/6399 (5432/6379 occupied). verify.sh wired: build shared → prisma generate → lint → typecheck → test.
- Evidence: prisma migrate dev --name init clean (HealthPing created); verify.sh exit 0.
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005, ADR-0006
- By: human-approved (build via subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — V2 independent review
- What: Independent reviewer ran verify.sh itself + audited scaffold vs spec + ARCHITECTURE. Verdict APPROVE after 3 minor fixes: F1 PWA icons (192/512 + maskable) so app is installable, F2 counter test now actually clicks, F3 web typecheck added to verify.sh. No P0.
- Evidence: reviewer verify.sh exit 0 (backend 5/5, web 3/3); grep found zero `any`/`@ts-ignore`/`eslint-disable`; BullMQ test confirmed real (not mocked).
- Decisions: none
- By: agent (independent reviewer subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — CHORE-001 — CLOSED (V3 + commit)
- What: Closer ran verify.sh 3× back-to-back — all exit 0, identical (backend 5 tests/3 suites, web 3 tests) → not flaky. git repo initialized; scaffold committed. REGISTRY → done.
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 ×3 (RUN1_EXIT=0, RUN2 identical, third run exit 0). Commit efd1526.
- Decisions: ADR-0002, ADR-0005, ADR-0006
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — opened, spec drafted (awaiting approval)
- What: Created loop/work/FEAT-001-society-onboarding-otp-auth/ with spec.md (Society+Resident model, invite-code + phone-OTP onboarding, JWT access+refresh, roles, tenant isolation). 6 open questions pending human answers. No code until spec/plan approved (Loop rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (spec only)
- Decisions: ADR-0003 (applies); JWT-auth + OTP-storage ADRs to be written at plan time
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — open questions resolved; plan + tasks drafted
- What: Human resolved all 6 open questions (full-stack scope, stub SMS adapter, seed-script super-admin, default OTP policy). Wrote ADR-0007 (phone-OTP + JWT rotating refresh, OTP in Redis), plan.md, and tasks.md (15 tasks: backend T1–T9, frontend T10–T13, V2/V3 close). Status → planned. Awaiting plan approval before code (Loop rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (plan only)
- Decisions: ADR-0007
- By: agent (pending human plan approval)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — plan approved; backend build started (T1–T9)
- What: Human approved the plan (execute backend-first, then PWA) and approved the one new dependency `@nestjs/jwt`. Status → in-progress. Building T1–T9 (Prisma model, shared types, notifications stub, OtpService, AuthService+JWT, endpoints, guards/roles, tenant-isolation test, seed script).
- Evidence: pending (verify.sh at task completion)
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0007; dependency @nestjs/jwt approved
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — backend T1–T9 built (pre-review)
- What: Backend implemented: Society/Resident model (+migration, HealthPing removed), notifications stub, OtpService (Redis, hashed OTP, attempt/rate limits), AuthService+JWT rotating refresh, auth endpoints, role guards, GET /residents/:id (society-scoped), tenant-isolation test, seed script. Dep @nestjs/jwt@^11 (pinned CommonJS).
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 (backend 27 tests/9 suites, web 3) per builder.
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0007
- By: agent (build subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — V2 independent review: CHANGES REQUESTED
- What: Independent reviewer ran verify.sh itself (27/27 backend, 3/3 web, exit 0 ×2) and audited auth+tenancy. All acceptance criteria MET; tenant isolation verified genuinely enforced; tests real (HTTP + real DB/Redis, OTP never leaked). No active auth-bypass/tenant-leak. Findings: P1 hardcoded fallback secrets + no env validation (missing from .env.example); P2s: non-atomic OTP verify counter, INCR/EXPIRE split, JWT alg not pinned, seed Node-20 portability.
- Evidence: reviewer verify.sh exit 0 ×2; grep clean (no any/ts-ignore/console); Lua atomic refresh confirmed.
- Decisions: none (fixes tracked under ADR-0007 hardening)
- By: agent (independent reviewer subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — applying V2 fixes (P1 + security P2s)
- What: Sent fixes to builder: remove hardcoded secret fallbacks + add fail-fast env validation via class-validator (no new dep) + add secret keys to .env/.env.example; make OTP verify-attempt + hourly-resend counters atomic (Lua); pin JWT alg HS256; fix seed Node portability. Re-verify to follow.
- Evidence: pending re-verify
- Decisions: none
- By: human-approved (fixes directed by reviewer findings)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — backend hardening verified; T1–T9 CHECKPOINT (committed)
- What: Closer independently re-ran verify.sh (exit 0; backend 27/27, web 3/3) and read the security fixes: env.validation.ts (fail-fast, secrets ≥16), auth.service HS256 + throwing secret getters (grep confirms no fallback), otp.service atomic VERIFY_LUA + RESEND_HOURLY_LUA. .env gitignored; .env.example placeholders only. Backend (T1–T9) committed 32db18c. Feature remains in-progress (PWA T10–T13 + V3 close pending). Backend checkpoint passed → awaiting go for PWA chunk.
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 (27 backend / 3 web); fail-fast boot confirmed by reviewer (missing secret → BOOT_EXIT=1); commit 32db18c.
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0007
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — PWA chunk started (T10–T13); dep react-router-dom approved
- What: Human approved proceeding to the PWA onboarding UI and adding react-router-dom. Building: Zustand auth store + API client with refresh interceptor + token persistence, 3-step onboarding (invite→phone→OTP→logged-in), authed landing + logout, route guards, Vitest/RTL tests.
- Evidence: pending (verify.sh at completion)
- Decisions: dependency react-router-dom approved
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — PWA T10–T13 built
- What: React PWA onboarding: Zustand auth store (persisted), api client with single-flight refresh+retry, 3-step wizard (invite→phone→OTP), react-router-dom guards, authed landing from /me, logout, Vitest/RTL tests. Only new dep react-router-dom. Discovered shadcn/ui was never installed by scaffold → hand-rolled shadcn-style primitives (no new deps).
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 (web 13 tests/6 files, backend 27) per builder; web PWA build intact.
- Decisions: react-router-dom
- By: agent (build subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — frontend V2 review: APPROVE
- What: Independent reviewer ran verify.sh itself ×2 (exit 0, web 13/6 + backend 27/9) + PWA build. Refresh single-flight/no-loop verified, route guards correct, server state via TanStack Query (not duplicated in store), API contract matches backend exactly, tests real. No P0/P1. P2 notes: shadcn doc-drift, vestigial society field, missing HomePage/AnonymousRoute tests, leftover demo files.
- Evidence: reviewer verify.sh exit 0 ×2; grep clean (no any/ts-ignore); only react-router-dom added.
- Decisions: none
- By: agent (independent reviewer subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-001 — CLOSED (V3 + doc fix + commit)
- What: Fixed shadcn doc-drift honestly — ADR-0008 (hand-rolled shadcn-style primitives) + corrected STACK.md/ARCHITECTURE.md/CLAUDE.md. Closer ran V3: verify.sh ×2 back-to-back, both exit 0, identical (web 13/6, backend 27/9) → not flaky. REGISTRY → done. 3 P2 follow-ups recorded in tasks.md for later triage.
- Evidence: V3 verify.sh RUN1_EXIT=0, RUN2_EXIT=0 identical.
- Decisions: ADR-0008
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — opened, spec drafted (awaiting approval)
- What: Created loop/work/FEAT-002-service-catalog/ with spec.md (Service master + per-society ServiceOffering, resident GET /catalog scoped by society, super-admin catalog API, resident catalog screen, seed). 3 open questions (visibility model, admin-UI scope, categories) pending. No code until spec/plan approved (rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (spec only)
- Decisions: ADR-0003 (applies)
- By: agent

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — open questions resolved; plan + tasks drafted
- What: Human resolved: per-society ServiceOffering (ADR-0009), admin API+seed now (UI in FEAT-005), free-text categories. Wrote ADR-0009, plan.md, tasks.md (T1–T6 backend, T7–T9 frontend, T10–T11 close). Status → planned. Awaiting plan approval before code (rule 2).
- Evidence: n/a (plan only)
- Decisions: ADR-0009
- By: agent (pending human plan approval)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — plan approved; full build started (T1–T9)
- What: Human approved the plan (build all in one chunk). Status → in-progress. Building catalog model + resident GET /catalog + super-admin catalog API + seed + resident catalog screen + tests. No new deps.
- Evidence: pending (verify.sh at completion)
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0009
- By: human-approved

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — T1–T9 built
- What: Catalog model (Service + ServiceOffering), society-scoped GET /catalog (single joined query), super-admin catalog API (services + offerings), seed +5 services enabled for both societies, resident /services screen (cards + empty/error/loading). No new deps.
- Evidence: verify.sh exit 0 (backend 38/11, web 16/7) per builder; seed idempotent; web PWA build ok.
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0009
- By: agent (build subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — V2 independent review: APPROVE
- What: Reviewer ran verify.sh itself ×2 (exit 0, backend 38/38, web 16/16, identical) + web build + seed idempotency (2×, no dupes). Tenant isolation verified genuine (B-only offering absent from A's /catalog; societyId only from verified JWT; single joined query, no N+1). All /admin/* class-guarded @Roles(SUPER_ADMIN), resident→403, slug→409, unknown→404. No P0/P1. P2: missing 403 assertion on PATCH + 404-path assertions (code correct, tests absent) → being added before close.
- Evidence: reviewer verify.sh exit 0 ×2; grep clean; no new dep.
- Decisions: none
- By: agent (independent reviewer subagent)

## 2026-09-16 — FEAT-002 — CLOSED (V3 + commit)
- What: Added 2 P2 test-coverage items (PATCH 403 + 404 not-found paths → backend 41 tests). Closer ran V3: verify.sh ×2 back-to-back, both exit 0, identical (backend 41, web 16) → not flaky. REGISTRY → done.
- Evidence: V3 RUN1=0, RUN2=0 identical.
- Decisions: ADR-0003, ADR-0009
- By: agent (autonomous — per owner directive to run the loop without per-step approval)
